# Ask Me Anything

A classic 8 Ball ask me anything web app, built using Flutter.

### How to Run
- Clone the repo to your computer using: 
  `git clone https://github.com/pranavdhawan/ask-me-anything`
- Launch a web server using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. That's what I use :}
- Navigate to `localhost:8000` in your web browser and redirect to the dirctory in which you cloned the repository.
